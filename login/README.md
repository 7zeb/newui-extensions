### About this project
the NewUI Login Extension is an extension to add account support to your site, it provides a CSS add-on with login elements, and has a HTML template, and profile picture already ready. Just take your CSS, HTML, and add your own backend.

This project DOES NOT include the backend, since this is a CSS extension, not a full login template.
